# EMMAT: Efficient Multi-Modal Language Model Auto Trainer

EMMAT is a powerful and efficient framework for training large-scale language models that can leverage multi-modal data, adapt to new tasks quickly, and continuously improve their performance. It combines state-of-the-art techniques such as Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Pruning (DKDP), Multi-Modal Adversarial Transfer Learning (MMATL), and AXOLOTL (A fleXible cOmpositional neural architecture for Language mOdel Transfer Learning) to create a comprehensive and adaptable language model training pipeline.

## Features

- Multi-Modal Pre-training: EMMAT can leverage large-scale multi-modal datasets, including text, images, audio, and other relevant modalities, to pre-train the language model and learn rich representations.
- Compositional Architecture: EMMAT employs a modular and compositional architecture that allows for the flexible combination of different neural components, such as transformers, RNNs, and CNNs, to capture various aspects of language.
- Task-Specific Adapters: EMMAT introduces task-specific adapters that can be attached to the pre-trained language model for efficient transfer learning and adaptation to new tasks.
- Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Pruning: EMMAT incorporates DKDP techniques to dynamically optimize the model size and performance by distilling knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model and pruning less important parameters.
- Adversarial Training: EMMAT utilizes adversarial training techniques from MMATL to improve the robustness and generalization of the language model by encouraging it to generate outputs that are indistinguishable from human-generated text.
- Curriculum Learning: EMMAT supports curriculum learning strategies to gradually increase the complexity of the training data and tasks, enabling the model to learn more efficiently and effectively.
- Multi-Task Learning: EMMAT allows for simultaneous training of the language model on multiple related tasks using task-specific adapters, facilitating knowledge sharing and improving overall performance.
- Continual Learning: EMMAT implements continual learning mechanisms to enable the model to adapt to new data and tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.
- Hyperparameter Optimization: EMMAT includes automated hyperparameter optimization techniques to find the optimal configuration for the language model and training process.
- Model Compression: EMMAT applies model compression techniques, such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, to reduce the size and computational requirements of the language model.

## Getting Started

To get started with EMMAT, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare your multi-modal dataset:
   - Collect and preprocess large-scale multi-modal datasets, including text, images, audio, and other relevant modalities.
   - Ensure that the samples from each modality are properly aligned and synchronized.

3. Configure the EMMAT settings:
   - Modify the configuration file (`config.py`) to specify the desired model architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings.

4. Train the EMMAT model:
   ```
   python train.py --config config.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the trained model:
   ```
   python evaluate.py --model path/to/trained/model
   ```

6. Fine-tune the model for specific tasks:
   - Use the task-specific adapters to fine-tune the pre-trained EMMAT model for your desired downstream tasks.
